# FEH ClubConnect
General Description: 

Contains the technical resources created by the ClubConnect team to demonstrate viability of initial MVP features.

Summary:

ClubConnect began as an ideation and creation project stemming from noticing the pains of collegiate clubs/communities, specifically group connection. Building off of this noticed pain, the team focused on our JTBD (job to be done) in centralizing club activities and information using a "one-stop-shop" app. The goal of the ClubConnect stands to provide value for college studens in accessibility to information, connection with peers, and welcoming environments full of opportunity. After conducting further interviews with subject matter experts, the team devised a target market (college students), user personas (Nate Merrit), and began brainstorming the design features that will bring the desired value to the market. The design features are included here in the repository and the project's minimum viable product pitch will include how this software will fare over the next 5 years for both ClubConnect and investors.

Components of Repository:

The following repository includes two seperate features and corresponding JUnit testing, UML Diagrams, a representation of the software's front end UI design using Figma, documentation detailing the features operating instructions, a flyer, and a pitch video.

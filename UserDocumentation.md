**Figma:**

To use the Figma application, click the "play" button on the Figma website. This will open up a new window showcasing a demonstration of the ClubConnect UI. The Figma currently includes navigation features to the Main page, the Home page, the Search page, a demo club page, and the Calendar page. Use the corresponding buttons to navigate through the Figma. If further instruction is necessary, reference the included Figma UI video in the repository.

**FEH Interest Survey:**

The purpose of the Interest Survey is to determine a "club genre" that best suits each individual user. To do so, the program prompts the user to answer a series of questions related to different "club genres". These responses are then assessed, scored, and returned in the form of a "club genre". This result will ultimately be the starting input for a recommendation feature the team will implement in the future after securing an appropriate club database. 
To run the program, simply copy the code into an IDE of your choosing that supports Java. Then, run the code and enter a rating from 1 to 5 for each question. The results will automatically be returned for you based on your responses.

**FEH Search Bar (file.html):**

The purpose of the Search Bar is to allow users to search for and peruse the various club options at their disposal. When entering the name of a desired club, only clubs following the same syntax as your club will be reported back. Users may then access each linked club to their respective club pages. For the time being, these links reference the OSU club directory but will be shifted to updated versions through ClubConnect in the near future.
To run the program, simply copy the code into an IDE of your choosing that supports both JavaScript and HTML. Then, run the code. A new window will open and users can directly access the search bar and club examples.
